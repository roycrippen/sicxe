# SicDemos

A collection of assembly programs for the SIC/XE computer architecture. SicDemos is a companion project of [SicTools](https://github.com/jurem/SicTools) project (SIC/XE hypothetical computer simulator).

Demos are structured into several folders.

Non-interactive programs (which only produce some output) are found in:
* 'stdinout' ... programs using standard input and output
* 'text-screen' ... programs using textual screen
* 'graph-screen' ... programs using graphical screen

Other (interactive) programs are (usually) in their own folders.

Enjoy!
